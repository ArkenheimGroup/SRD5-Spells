# SRD5-Spells
A repository of Spells for the 5th edition of the world's greatest roleplaying game, all licenced as Open Game Content.

## What it is.
This repo contains spells for the 5th edition of the world's greatest roleplaying game. These spells are licenced as Open Gaming Content ("OGC") and provided in a human- and machine-readable format; YAML. 

Spells are sourced from Open Game Content released by various publishers as well as from the "homebrew" community.

## What it isn't.

- A copy of the spells from the "D&D 5th Edition Player's Handbook" (since those spells aren't OGC) or any other publication that doesn't indicate the spells are OGC. 

- Homebrew content taken from the community without permission

- Content from older editions, or other games, taken without permission. 

## Okay, so what is Open Game Content ("OGC")?
OGC, or Open Game Content, is content released under the terms of the Open Game Licence ("OGL"), a public copyright license created by Wizards of The Coast ("Wizards"). This doesn't mean that OGC is created by Wizards, only that is is released under a licence created by Wizards.

Here's a definition from Wikipedia:
 
> The Open Game License (OGL) is a public copyright license that may be used by tabletop role-playing game developers to grant permission to modify, copy, and redistribute some of the content designed for their games, notably game mechanics. However, they must share-alike copies and derivative works.

You can check out the licence here: [Open Game Licence](http://www.opengamingfoundation.org/ogl.html).

## How do I add stuff?
That's super easy but differs a little depending on what you want to add:

### Your own content
Simply markup your spells in YAML format and save as a .yaml file. Make sure to append the OGL to the document and include your copyright notice. Then submit a pull request.

### Other people's content, that's already OGC / a derivative of someone else's OGC
Same as with your own content, but make sure to include the original copyright notice. If you modify the work, keep the original notice and add your own too.

### Other people's content that isn't OGC
You cant! That would be a copyright violation and you're likely to be sued. You could always contect them ask them to release the content as OGC.
